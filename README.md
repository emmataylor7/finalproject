# Phylogenetic Biology - Final Project

## Guidelines - you can delete this section before submission

This is a stub for your final project. Edit/ delete the text in this readme as needed.

There are two ways you can use this document:  
- You can download this file to a folder on your computer, edit this document and add other files (data, code, etc), and then zip up and submit the folder on canvas.
- You can for the [repository](finalproject) containing this document on gitub. Then commit and push your canges to the repository, and submit a link to the repository on canvas.

Github is a great way to work on projects, but also has a steep initial learning curve.


Some guidelines and tips:

- Use the stubs below to write up your final project. Alternatively, if you would like the writeup to be an executable document (with [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), [jupytr](http://jupyter.org/), or other tools), you can create it as a separate file and put a link to it here in the readme.

- For information on formatting text files with markdown, see https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ . You can use markdown to include images in this document by linking to files in the repository, eg `![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)`.

- The project must be entirely reproducible. In addition to the results, the repository must include all the data (or links to data) and code needed to reproduce the results.

- If you are working with unpublished data that you would prefer not to publicly share at this time, please contact me to discuss options. In most cases, the data can be anonymized in a way that putting them in a public repo does not compromise your other goals.

- Paste references (including urls) into the reference section, and cite them with the general format (Smith at al. 2003).

OK, here we go.

# Evolution of Venom in Snakes

## Introduction and Goals

Saliva in snakes and a limited number of other lizards has evolved into venom that organisms can use to subdue to kill prey. There is debate over this evolutionary history, especially when examining morphological versus molecular phylogenies and studies. Convergent evolution has been suggested for some modes of venom evolution, such as between snakes, spiders, and snails, meanwhile independent evolution is suggested for modes of venom delivery, such as specialized fangs.

A mid-2000s theory proposed that venom evolved once and was present in the clade named “Toxicofera” and was subsequently lost in various lineages. However, a 2014 study found that conserved venom proteins across Toxicofera lineages were misinterpreted and that instead venom evolved independently multiple times. Even still, the original hypothesis is supported (Rao et al, 2022). I will look to examine gene sequences in species of venomous and non-venomous snakes to determine how to best represent venom evolution with phylogenetics and gene sequencing.

The goal of my project is to answer the questions: how did venom in snakes evolve and how can this best be described phylogenetically? 

The methods I will use to do this are an analysis of the available data using a text editor (Visual Studio Code). I will then align the data sequences using MAFFT. After aligning the sequences with MAFFT, I will determine where genetic variation in the sequences occurs, specifically after insertion and deletion events. Using IQTREE, I will infer a phylogeny of various snake clades according to their venom evolution. 

The data I will use are publicly available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s (NCBI) Taxonomy Browser. Species sequences will be taken from the clades Acrochordoidea, Xenodermatidae, Pareatidae, Viperidae, Colubridae, Elapidae, and Lamprophiidae.
